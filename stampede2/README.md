For the official Stampede2 documentation, refer to 
[https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2) .

Stampede2 works on
[Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

# Prerequisites

**TACC Account:** You can get one using your UT EID on the 
[TACC user portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/).

**Project Membership:** You need to be added in an active TACC project in Cenik Lab in order to start using Stampede2. Otherwise, the system will not let you log in.

**Multifactor Authentication(MFA)**: Note that Stampede2 requires a two step authentication. 
So, you need the 
[TACC token app](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication). 
It can be installed on an Android or Apple device and paired with your account. Follow the instructions on 
[TACC page](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication) for setup.

**SSH Client**: OS X and Linux comes with terminal. So no additional software is needed. 
Windows users can install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) as an ssh client.

# Logging in
Once you create your TACC account and setup MFA app and have a project membership, 
you can start using stampede2. Have your MFA app ready before you log in.

```
ssh $TACCUSER@stampede2.tacc.utexas.edu
```
where $TACCUSER should be replaced by your TACC user name.

The system will first ask for your password. Then, it will ask for the one-time number generated by MFA app. 
Upon success, you will see the welcome message and then the command prompt.


# SSH Connection Multiplexing

If you usually need to work with more than one login terminals at the same time, 
going through the steps of MFA could be cumbersome.
To avoid this, you can use 
[SSH Connection Multiplexing](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing). 

Say, you are working on the same computer. You can establish the MFA only at the beginnig of your day. 
Every other ssh connection goes through your master (first) connection without the steps of MFA.

On **your machine ( = client machine)**, create the ssh configuration file:
```
vi ~.ssh/config
```
with the following content:
```
host *tacc.utexas.edu
   ControlMaster auto
   ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh%r@%h-%p
   ControlPersist 2h
```

After you save and close the configuration file, open an ssh connection. You will go through the steps of MFA.
Upon success, if you try to open another ssh connection, 
you should see that you log in without typing your password or the MFA token.
